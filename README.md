## Introduction

This repository contains the source code of the speculative ray scheduling technique described in the following paper:
```
SpRay: Speculative Ray Scheduling for Large Data Visualization
Hyungman Park, Donald Fussell, and Paul Navr√°til
Large Data Analysis and Visualization 2018
```

It also includes our implementations of the baseline algorithm described in the following paper:
```
Exploring the Spectrum of Dynamic Scheduling Algorithms for Scalable Distributed-Memory Ray Tracing.
Paul A. Navratil, Hank Childs, Donald S. Fussell, Calvin Lin
IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 2013
```

## Building Spray (Linux and Mac)

If you are using Apple Clang on a Mac, install `libomp`.
```bash
brew install libomp
```
Build and install [Embree][2]. We tested Spray with Embree v2.17.1.

Check out Spray with all submodules.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TACC/SpRay.git
cd SpRay
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Or simply,
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TACC/SpRay.git
cd SpRay
```
Create a build directory.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
If you are using Apple Clang on a Mac,
```bash
cmake -DOpenMP_INSTALL_DIR=$(brew --prefix libomp) -DEMBREE_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_embree_install> ..
```
Otherwise,
```bash
cmake -DEMBREE_INSTALL_DIR=<path_to_embree_install> ..
```
```bash
make
```
If you wish to install Spray,
```bash
make install
```

## Running Spray (Linux and Mac)

### Rendering isosurfaces of 64 domains

```bash
export SPRAY_HOME_PATH=<path_to_spray_home>
```
For film mode,
```bash
source $SPRAY_HOME_PATH/examples/wavelets64/wavelets64_film.sh
display spray.ppm
```
As you run the script, you'll see a list of applications to choose from. Those starting with `base_` are an implementation of our baseline algorithm in [the paper][3].

Notice that this bash script launches 2 MPI tasks using `mpirun -n 2`. You may have to modify the MPI command as needed.

For glfw mode,
```bash
source $SPRAY_HOME_PATH/examples/wavelets64/wavelets64_glfw.sh
```
Type the `q-key` to close the window.

If you wish to use installed binaries, you'll have to modify the variable `SPRAY_BIN` in the bash scripts and set runtime search paths, LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH, as needed.

You should see the following as a result:
